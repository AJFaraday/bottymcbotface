# Botty McBotface

A simple (nay, stupid!) Twitter bot to post random suggests for names of projects. With its origins
in the Boaty McBoatface saga (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Research_Ship) this bot runs at:

twitter.com/BottyMcBotface_

This code serves no purpose, other than as a warning to others that you shouldn't take all ideas
seriously!
